      This class is intended to prepare you for the publishing process. However, the mechanics of each platform's marketplace/store is not covered here, and is instead in the following recorded presentations.
		  We recommend you watch the specific video for the platform you are interested in publishing. 
      </p>

      <div class="wslist">
         <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/all#publishing-an-ios-app-ios220">Publishing an iOS application to the AppStore</a>
         <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/all#publishing-an-android-app-and220">Publishing an Android application to Google Play</a>
         <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/all#publishing-a-windows-phone-app-wp220">Publishing a Windows Phone application to the Windows Marketplace</a>
      </div>

      <p>
      In addition, keep in mind that the applications produced by Xamarin tools are completely native. 
		That means that the vendor documentation for the publishing process can also be used as a guide for publishing.
